I've gathered some thoughts formed while creating my first CRUD app using Sinatra, a project completed for my studies at Learn.co.  I've also added my 2 cents for those at a similar point in their studies of computer programming.

In the context of the Learn curriculum:
At this point, we've had a lot of practice being exposed to specific skills, trying them out in labs, and bringing them all together in a project.  We're building connections every time we move on to a new concept, not just with the material we've just learned but even bigger connections overarching themes we've learned from the start.

Advice: think of how the moving parts you're using/building fit into the bigger picture/context of things you've learned.

This approach to the curriculum I feel has helped me move with (a degree of) confidence through the labs.  Embrace the synergy, how is something you want to create emulating something you've already made?  Just as importantly, this gives you the freedom to search for jumping off points for something new.

Reduce, reuse, recycle:
The blank page I open at the start of a project doesn't feel quite so blank anymore.  I've found that taking the first step of working my idea into the framework of a recent lab does a few things:
-I get a free reminder of what the minimum infrastructure is supposed to look like, such as the file tree structure (app -> mvc, config -> environment, db -> migrations, etc.)
-I get to reuse and sometimes tweak specific methods (slugifying a string for a url)
-Tests come along already written with the rest of the package!

This might sound or feel a little like cheating, but remember we not only put the work in to get those labs working in the first place but we also get to know that material from a different perspective.  I believe that this gives us a better understanding of what we've learned than simply completing the lab could.

Advice: look for specific areas of overlap to help you along/inspire new ideas.

A word on testing:
Testing is by its nature a two sided process.  Writing good tests for your code involves both having thorough comprehension of not only our code but the behavior and limits of a test written for code as well.  Over the course of this projectI discovered I really need to pay some additional attention to learning how to drive the tests.

Advice: tests need love too!

And with that, it's time to submit my fridge inventory app, FridgeIt!
