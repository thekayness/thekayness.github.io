Okay, so it is finally time to write a Rails app!  What did I come up with?  CheerPace!  It's a platform for people to keep track of all their self-paced courses.  Is this special? No, but the main page has a feed of everyone's courses starting with the oldest.  That way, if you don't feel the motivation, other people can chime in and offer you encouragement.  The idea is that everyone cheers each other on to finish classes that may be exciting to sign up for but difficult to find the time/motivation to work on.

What did I take away from this process?  Start with the smallest possible question you can answer about your problem domain and work upwards from there in increments as tiny as you can make them.  The `rails new <project_name>` alone is enough to drown you in files and folders and configurations, and they only increase in number!  I found myself falling victim to file creep*tm* time and time again.  Do I need that controller?  What spec just got generated?? What is even going on in here???

Deep breath, Kathleen.  I made it through to the other side, somehow.  I found myself struggling with routes and nested forms, you really can't do too much reading with those topics!  I also suspect that file creep played a role in my routes/forms misunderstandings.  Regardles, I continue to remind myself that the time spent in what feels like fruitless attempts to move closer to a solution is never wasted time.  I've always come away from these periods exhausted, a little triumphant, and (hopefully) wise to whatever stumped me.

I'm very excited to see where else Rails might take me in the future!
