JQuery and I haven't always been friends, I think we are just now arriving at aquaintences.  I have certainly been struggling with my own interface between Rails' ActiveModel Serializers and my asset pipeline.  It can be awkward switching tracks between JavaScript and Ruby, but the more time I spend with it the easier it becomes.  Making and consuming data from my own API has been a really neat experience!  Seeing the other side of the API equation really rounded out my understanding of how APIs work, and has made it much easier to explain to others now.

At this point in the curriculum I feel the need to take pause and examine just how far I've come in the last 6 months or so.  It feels kind of like giant tectonic plates have been forming and moving around my brain, continents of knowledge building and shifting as I learn to piece different aspects of web development together.  On one hand, I feel like my code senses have sharpened!  My taste in well written code is definitely on the rise.  Other days I feel like I write myself into a corner and lose track of my way out.  I've learned to make my feedback loops as short as possible, and even if I think I'm not making any progress, it all counts towards time in the sandbox.

It feels like I've absorbed a huge amount of material in recent history (Object Oriented Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, JQuery), but I have to keep in mind that the learning really begins the day this course ends.  I think this course has done a good job of training me to always be reassessing my understanding of a subject and how to seek out the right resources to fill any gaps.

I'm almost to the finish line, one more section on Angluar.js stands in my way.  I'M COMING FOR YOU ANGULAR! Watch out!
