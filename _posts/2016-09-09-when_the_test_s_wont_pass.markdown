I am writing to you know from the land of Onemoretest, a place of desolation and despair.  I've been feeling great about my progress over the past week but this morning got derailed on what I'm sure will be a misstep no larger than a few characters in my code.  I feel as though I have a good grasp of the condepts I'm supposed to be employing in this lab and I've gotten every test outlined in the spec file to pass with green lights but for one.  I've tested everything on my end as well as I know how to, and my app is behaving according to the test logic.  Tempted as I may be to give in to frustration, my intrepid instructor has stuck by my side this whole time, reviewing my changes and making suggestions.

I might feel ready to give up, but I know that my mistake will be revealed and I will get all of those tests to pass.  I have faith that the source of my error is out there somewhere, and that it can't hide from me for much longer.  I have no doubt that upon learning my exact mistake my knowledge of the tool at hand will be expanded and my proccess will adapt to counter this flaw in my understanding.  To all those out there seeking the solution to whatever last test, I say do not lose courage!  We will prevail over our code and be the better for it!
