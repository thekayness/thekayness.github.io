I really hope no one minds that I get a bit cheesy in these blog posts.  My jokes are so bad you'd think I was actually made out of cheese.  Jokes aside, I learned a lot from just watching myself code for 15 minutes.  For our portfolio projects we are required to make a recording of ourselves working.  It's just hitting me now that these strokes of insight about how I work might be exactly why we're required to do this.

After getting over the usual initial shock of hearing the sound of my own voice, I grew alarmed at the frequency with which I sang to myself as I tried to debug a particular piece of functionality.  I mean, whatever works...right?  It was also painful to watch how slowly I arrived at the solution to my particular problem (a one character typo).  In the end, I suppose I have to make peace with all of this because ultimately, it's part of my process for working through code.  I'm tempted to keep up this habit of recording myself working every now and again to try to discover more about this process.

On a different note (hah) my suspicions were confirmed that the end of class here at Learn.co is really only the beginning.  I wrote some JavaScript today that someone paid me to write and it was a pretty amazing feeling!
```
$('.thing').click(function() {
    console.log("Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii");
});
```
I wish I could say it was more complicated than this but I really can't.

The biggest takeaway from this course is the ability to learn and learn quickly.  When I was worried that I would never understand how to get something working at my job, I tried to think back to my first programming class four years ago, when even the concept of strings in Python went soaring over my head. 

My goals for the future are to
1. keep dreaming big
2. investigate hardware hacking
3. ABC (Always Be Coding)
