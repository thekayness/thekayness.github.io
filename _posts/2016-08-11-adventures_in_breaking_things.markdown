Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Just Commit

The following is basically the steps I went through in my mind to build my Command Line Interface Data Ruby Gem.  

Step 1 Figure Out Topic
- browse programmable web
- notice beer as a category
- research various beer related apis -- there are a few of these, who knew???
- find one that works!  -- and maybe not old, but I'll accept just working

Step 2 Figure Out Approach
- realize that student scraper functionality has everything we need
- it is so similar I'm recycling the whole thing

Step 3 Start Making Things happen
- copy entirety student scraper into cli assessment folder -- commit
- comment up all the student scraper code -- actually committed here
- copy over student scraper specs -- commit
- comment up all the student scraper specs! --commit
- change over student scraper specs to brewery fetcher specs -- commit
- create small tester file to refine api query requests -- commit
- do some testing, be wrong -- commit
- try and record some video -- get attacked by giant moth, get bothered by SO, accidentally stop recording
- while listening to myself, realize what I was doing wrong -- and that my voice sounds like I'm 10 years old
- record some more video
- pass first tests -- celebrate
- get more tests passing
- spend all day adjusting the CLI model
- get stuck on an obvious bug for 4 hours
- get final CLI logic up and running
- figure out the actual gem process...hint it's complicated maybe

Thoughts:
- a blank page is intimidating, drawing parallels between your model and an existing one is not
- reusing testing feels great too!
- start throwing spaghetti at the wall-something sticks, but don't stay here too long, you might be moving further from the solution
- when you find a stubborn bug write down what you try to fix it, that way you won't get stuck chasing your tail for hours
- sometimes at the end of it all, you picked an API that goes down right when you're ready to submit
  - cry a little, hope it goes back up
